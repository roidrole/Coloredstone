Adds 16-colored version of the vanilla redstone components (dust, repeater, torch, lamps, comparators). They can all interact with eachother and redstone-using blocks. They are not craftable by default. Use CraftTweaker or GroovyScript to add crafts.

This mod was made because Colored Redstone uses tile entities to store the colors, which is incompatible with blockstate-based methods such as Jsoned Old Obsidian. This rewrite ensures that no tile entities are used.
